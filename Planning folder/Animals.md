# Animals

- Predators
  - Search non-plant grass, sand & rock tiles for prey creatures
  - Use LOS pathfinding to reach target
  - Consume.
  - Move randomly to find targets if none are in sight
- Prey
  - Search tiles for plants
  - Move randomly if none are found
  - Flee nearby predators
- Other ideas
  - Make all creatures have a herb/omni/carnivorous stat, carn & omni search for smaller creatures
    - Omni could have 1 extra gene, percentage to hunt instead of gather
