# Genes

- Leg length (either global or per-leg)
  - Calculate a coefficient for speed based on the uneveness if local
  - Really long legs might cause creature to fall
- Neck length, longer necks decrease speed but allow eating from tall trees, and increase view range
- Eyesight, affects view range
- Gestation period, lower amounts speed up birthing but apply negative coefficients to some genes
- Attractiveness, some coeff, may increase visibility
- Selectivity, as this increases the creature will want more attractive mate
- Turn chance, higher # means higher chance of turning per movement
- Hunger priority, coeff for hunger value
- Thirst priority, coeff for thirst value
- Flee priority, coeff for distance to predator value
- Mate priority, coeff for mate-search value
